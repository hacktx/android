uMAD Android App
------

Hosting a conference? We put together this app for our annual developer conference, [uMAD](http://umad.me), and it's simple to configure it for your event as well. Check it out on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.utcs.mad.umad).

* Built on [Parse](http://parse.com) (free up to 30 requests a second), so you can change information and times without resubmitting
* Twitter stream from your organization
* Analytics for app opens, individual tab opens and crashes (free through Parse)

### Configuration

Rename the `example.props` file to `private.props`. Fill in each of the variables with the proper keys from Twitter and Parse.
